        <h1>MATH 4161 Mathematics of Cryptography</h1>

        <h2>Overview of MATH 4161 Mathematics of Cryptography</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Cryptography deals with the study of making and breaking secret codes.</p>

        <p>In this course we will be studying situations that are often framed as a game between three parties: a sender (e.g., an embassy), a receiver (the government office) and an opponent (a spy). We assume that the sender needs to get an urgent message to the receiver through communication channels which are vulnerable to the opponent. To do this communication, the sender and receiver agree in advance to use some sort of code which is unlocked by a keyword or phrase. The opponent will be able to intercept the message. Is he/she able to unlock the message without knowing the key?</p>

        <p>In this course we will learn some probability theory, information theory and number theory to answer questions about how vulnerable the methods of sending secrets are. This has a great number of applications to internet credit card transactions, wireless communication and electronic voting. We will start by learning some classical codes (used up through WWI) and analyzing those. The last third of the course we will start to learn the methods that are used in modern cryptography.</p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

        <p>At least 12 credits from 2000-level (or higher) MATH courses (without second digit "5", or second digit "7"); or LE/EECS 3101 3.00 or permission of the Instructor.</p>

        <h3>Covered Material</h3>

        <p>Topics that are covered in class include</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Probability Theory</li>
            <li>Information Theory</li>
            <li>Number Theory</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Format</h2>

        <p>Starting Tuesday, January 9, in-person lectures will be given at 10:00-11:30 AM every Tuesday and Thursday (PSE 321).</p>

        <h2>Assignments and Score</h2>

        <h3>Assignments (50% of total score)</h3>

        <p>You will be receiving an email for your unique assignment, and you are required to submit it on eClass. There are 20 questions in total, however the best 15 of 20 will count and the remaining will be extra credit towards the final exam.</p>

        <h3>Tests (30% of total score)</h3>

        <p>There will be three tests on TBD. It will be a written exam given during regular class time and location that can only be written in person.</p>

        <h3>Final Exam (20% of total score)</h3>

        <p>A cumulative final exam will be given during the final examination period. It will be a three-hour written exam that can only be taken in-person.</p>

        <h2>Letter Grade</h2>

        <p>The final score will be calculated based on homework assignments (30%), the midterm exam (30%), and the final exam (40%). Your letter grade will then be assigned based on the standard York University undergraduate grading scheme: 90.00%-100.00% A+, 80.00%-89.99% A, 75.00%-79.99% B+, 70.00%-74.99% B, 65.00%-69.99% C+, 60.00%-64.99% C, 55.00%-59.99% D+, 50.00%-54.99% D, 40.00%-49.99% E, 0-39.99% F.</p>

        <h2>Lecture Notes</h2>

        <p>In-person notes will be uploaded here. It is best to attend in-person classes as often as possible.</p>
